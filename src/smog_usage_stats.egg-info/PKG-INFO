# smog_usage_stats

A Python wrapper for interacting with Smogon's Pokemon Showdown usage stats data [found here](https://smogon.com/stats) and making it accessible in usable data structures.

## Quick Rundown

### Installing:

`pip install smog-usage-stats`

If your system uses `pip3` instead of `pip`, use that.

### How it all works

`BaseStatsSearch` -> Retrieves metagame usage statistics for non-Monotype metagames.

[[ Example here ]]

`MonotypeStatsSearch` -> searches the monotype stats directory

[[ Example here ]]

`BaseChaosSearch` -> searches the chaos data contained within a certain months stats
data

[[ Example here ]]

`MonotypeChaosSearch` -> searches the monotype chaos data contained within a certain
months stats data

[[ Example here ]]


`IndividualStatsSearch`  -> 
[[ Example here ]]
