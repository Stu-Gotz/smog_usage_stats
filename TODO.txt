create updater functionalit to query and store to db then update
class updater:

   ### MAYBE. might do another way since it kind of 
   already performs this function in a better way during 
   BaseStatsSearch._build_urls() 
   ###
   updater.get_tiers_from_date -> gets tiers from date, from current month, starting at month before, then one before that and the one before the 2nd one.
      eg: it is October
         search for September (current), August(previous) and July(tma)
   split by removing gen# and anything after the dash. eg: gen7ubers-1500.txt -> ubers 
   
   ###these feel much more concrete
   updater.set_query(params) -> sets up the basestatslookup with required params
      should have a flag for monotype or no (isMonotype = false!)
   updater.search_and_save() to call the search function, save CSVs
   updater.update_database() pass current, previous, tma as strings for the output, probably do this in a loop of some kind, maybe even make a new class that contains paramaters in an object
